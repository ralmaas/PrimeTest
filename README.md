Prime-testing

Inspired by Ralph Bacon

He made a small Arduino-program for testing "find primes 
in 30 seconds" and ran it on different platforms.

I have made a small extension and have "ported" it to c and Python

The result of my testing:

Platform	Number of primes	Factor
========= ======				====
TinyPico  	2802				73
UNO		  	3850				100
ESP8266	   28012				728
ESP32	  180045				4676
RPi ZW	  185766				4825
RPi		 3246945				6414
